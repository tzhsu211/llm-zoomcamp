    "\n",
    "In this project, we are working with **53 different types of supplements**. To enhance our retrieval process for these supplements, we employed **Google Gemini Pro** as our language model for generating augmented questions. Google Gemini Pro was chosen over alternatives like Ollama-Phi3 due to its **superior speed and efficiency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each supplement, we generated **5 distinct questions** based on the provided supplement information, resulting in a total of **265 questions**. These questions were then stored in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of our retrieval system, we use **Elasticsearch** to search for these questions and assess if the generated questions can be accurately matched with the original queries. The performance of the retrieval system is measured using two key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hit Rate**: Measures the proportion of queries for which relevant results are retrieved.\n",
    "- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Evaluates the average rank position of the first relevant result for a set of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps in validating the retrieval accuracy and effectiveness of our system in handling queries related to various supplements.\n",
